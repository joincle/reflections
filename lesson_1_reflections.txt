How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    open the two versions of a file in two windows, and compare with the two 
    versions manually

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Put all the entrie history of a file in the same file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: without install other tools; 
    cons: takes too much time, hard to find, take too much space, hard to track multiple files together,  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving multiple files in one commite is more suitable for programming application rather than dealing docs in one file using Google Docs

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I don't know, that's why I learn this course

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Save test good one 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Increasing my programming skills

In the long term, how to increase the efficiency of programming when you can easy access to the entire history of a file?

    Save more time on find changes of two versions of a file
    Save more time on copy the big files 
    Save less space of all the programming files
